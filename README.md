# Portfolio Website: Interactive 3D Experience ‚ú®

Welcome to my portfolio website's source code! This repository houses an immersive, three-dimensional portfolio experience that pushes the boundaries of web technology. Built with modern frameworks and tools, this project demonstrates the perfect blend of creativity and technical expertise.

## ‚ö° Core Technologies

- React + TypeScript for robust frontend architecture
- ThreeJS & WebGL for stunning 3D graphics
- GSAP for fluid, professional animations
- Modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript

## üöÄ Getting Started

**Important Note:** While this project uses GSAP animations, the current setup includes trial plugins which aren't suitable for production hosting. For production deployment, please acquire GSAP Club plugins from [GSAP's official documentation](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation/).

### Setup Process

First, get the code:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Set up React:
```bash
npm i react
```

Add GSAP to your project:
```bash
# For React-specific implementation
npm i gsap/react

# OR for standard GSAP
npm i gsap
```

Launch the development environment:
```bash
npm run dev
```
