# Portfolio Website: Interactive 3D Experience ‚ú®

Welcome to my portfolio website's source code! This repository houses an immersive, three-dimensional portfolio experience that pushes the boundaries of web technology. Built with modern frameworks and tools, this project demonstrates the perfect blend of creativity and technical expertise.

## ‚ö° Core Technologies

- React + TypeScript for robust frontend architecture
- ThreeJS & WebGL for stunning 3D graphics
- GSAP for fluid, professional animations
- Modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript

## üöÄ Getting Started

**Important Note:** While this project uses GSAP animations, the current setup includes trial plugins which aren't suitable for production hosting. For production deployment, please acquire GSAP Club plugins from [GSAP's official documentation](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation/).
